# ReactJs & Google Calendar

<img src="img/refinery.png">

 This task is a prototype of a booking system, where users can select appointmens for an event, based on
the free hours that the administrator has in his own Google Calendar.

 To do this I used the Google API and various of its resources, as the calendar and the authentication system.

 Once in the app, when one user selects one of the possible time for appointments, google calendar launches a popup
to handle the authentication of the user. Afterwards, if succesfully signed up,the event will be added
to the users Calendar, as well as to the calendar of the administrator. 

 In order to monitor the calendar, the administrator must to know the email account related to the Google Calendar, Google Project, Oauth and so on. That information will be provided through email by myself to the people who ordered me this task.
